# RabbitMQ Tutorial - "Hello World!" with .NET

This tutorial demonstrates how to use RabbitMQ with .NET to build a simple messaging application.

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll start with the simplest possible example: sending a "Hello World!" message from a .NET producer to a RabbitMQ queue and having a .NET consumer receive and process it. This straightforward scenario will serve as our introduction to RabbitMQ and its .NET client library.

### Key Terminology

- **Producer**: A producer is a program responsible for sending messages to RabbitMQ. It produces messages and sends them to a RabbitMQ queue.

- **Queue**: In RabbitMQ, a queue is like a postbox where messages are stored before being consumed. Messages are placed into a queue and wait to be delivered to consumers.

- **Consumer**: A consumer is a program that receives and processes messages from a RabbitMQ queue. It waits for messages to arrive and performs specific actions based on the received data.
